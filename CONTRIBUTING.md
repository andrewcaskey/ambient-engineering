### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

**Before Submitting A Bug Report:**
* Check the debugging guide for tips â€” you might discover that the issue is not a bug.
* Check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version.

**How Do I Submit A Bug Report?**
Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue and provide the following information:

* Use a clear and descriptive title
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem
* Describe the behavior you observed and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why
